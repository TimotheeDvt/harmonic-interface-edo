## 🌟 About

**Hello!** I'm Tim, a French musician and developer passionate about alternative tuning systems. This project allows you to experiment with EDO (Equal Divisions of the Octave) using an interactive visual interface, inspired by Levi McClain's work and innovations like Harmonync.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🎛️ Dynamic Multi-EDO**  
  Explore from standard 12-EDO to exotic divisions like 24-EDO (Arabic quarter tones) and 53-EDO (historical Turkish scale)
